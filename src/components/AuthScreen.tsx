I've analyzed the file and found several syntax issues with missing closing brackets and duplicated sections. Here's the corrected version with proper closures and structure:

The main issues were:

1. Duplicate form sections
2. Misplaced closing brackets for nested components
3. Multiple AuthScreen component definitions

The fix involves:

1. Removing duplicate form sections
2. Properly closing all brackets
3. Keeping only one AuthScreen component definition

I've reorganized the code to maintain a single coherent structure. The key fixes were:

1. Removing the duplicated form sections that appeared after the first AuthScreen component
2. Properly closing all JSX elements
3. Ensuring proper component structure

The file should now be properly structured with all brackets matched and no duplicate sections. The component is defined once and exports properly.

Would you like me to provide the specific line-by-line changes that were made to fix these issues?
