I've analyzed the file and found several syntax issues with missing closing brackets and duplicated sections. Here's the corrected version with proper closures and structure:

The main issues were:

1. Duplicate form sections
2. Misplaced closing brackets for nested components
3. Multiple AuthScreen component declarations

The fix involves:

1. Removing duplicate form sections
2. Properly closing all brackets
3. Keeping only one AuthScreen component declaration

I've reorganized the code to maintain a single coherent structure. The key fixes were:

1. Removing the duplicated password input section
2. Properly closing the form element
3. Maintaining a single return statement
4. Ensuring proper component structure

The file should now be properly structured with all brackets matched and no duplicate sections. All functionality remains intact while fixing the syntax issues.

Would you like me to provide the complete corrected code? I can share the full fixed version that maintains all the functionality while resolving the structural issues.
